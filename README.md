**Task 1 :**  Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.

**problem statement:** Predict The Percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

Finally, We have to **predict the score if student studies for 9.25 hrs/day.**

**Dataset :**  http://bit.ly/w-data

**Algorithm used:**  Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Algorithm is used.
